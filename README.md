# DSA with Java 🚀

This repository documents my **complete Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) preparation using Java**.  
It is a **long-term, daily practice repo** covering **all important DSA topics step-by-step**, followed **pattern-wise**, until I secure a placement.

This is not limited to loops or arrays — it includes **every core DSA concept** required for interviews.

---

## 📌 What this repository contains

This repo will gradually cover **all major DSA topics**, including:

- 🔁 Loops & conditionals
- ⭐ Pattern problems (foundation for logic building)
- 🧮 Functions & recursion
- 📦 Arrays (1D & 2D)
- 🔗 Strings
- 🧠 Searching & sorting algorithms
- 🧱 Hashing
- 📚 Stack & Queue
- 🌳 Trees & Binary Trees
- 🕸️ Graphs
- 💡 Recursion & Backtracking
- 📊 Dynamic Programming
- ⚙️ Bit Manipulation
- 🧪 Sliding Window & Two Pointer techniques
- 🧩 LeetCode / Interview-style problems

Each topic is practiced **pattern-wise**, starting from basics → optimized solutions.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- No copy-paste solutions
- Logic first, code second
- Problems are solved **step-by-step**
- Focus on **patterns**, not memorization
- Mistakes are allowed, skipping fundamentals is not
- Every concept is revisited and revised

---

## 📅 Daily Discipline

- Code **every single day**
- Make **small but meaningful commits**
- Maintain GitHub consistency
- Revise older problems regularly
- Improve code quality over time

This repo reflects **discipline, not speed**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To become **interview-ready in DSA using Java** and secure a **software development role**.

This repository will continue to grow **until placement is achieved**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **Practice Platforms:** LeetCode, HackerRank
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 📌 Note

This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a polished library.  
Code may start simple, but every solution is written with understanding and intent.

---

📈 Consistency builds confidence.  
📌 Fundamentals decide placements.
